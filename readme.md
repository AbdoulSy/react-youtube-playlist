## Test

Here's the application for displaying youtube vids from the Youtube API.

'npm install' to install dependencies and 'npm run start' to run theh application. 

## Thoughts

It's build in React and Flux instead of the prefered Angular. I think the logic behind React was best for this application. If you have any questions about my code or if anything is unclear because of React. Please let me know.
